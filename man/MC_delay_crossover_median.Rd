\item{n_e}{Number of patients in experimental}

\item{median_c_1}{Median in control before switching (and for patients that do not switch)}

\item{median_c_2}{Median in control after switching (for the patients that switches)}

\item{delay}{Delay time for when switching occurs}

\item{end_event}{Number of events in the study}

\item{rec_period}{Time for recruitment}

\item{rec_power}{Variable for recruitment that follows the power model}

\item{p}{Proportion(s) of patients that switches after the delay}

\item{HR_fun}{Pre specified HR function}
